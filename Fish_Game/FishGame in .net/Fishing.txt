(1) The Fish class 

A fish is defined by its species (e.g. "Pike", "Bass", "SunFish", etc.) and its size - an int indicating the size of the fish in cm.

(2) The Pond class

A pond contains various fish and is defined by its capacity - an int indicating the maximum number of fish that can be stored in the pond. It has the following behaviour:
    - add (ability to add a new fish to the pond)
    - catch (removes and returns a random fish from the pond)

(3) The Fisher class 

A fisher is the person with a name who goes to a given pond for fishing. He/she has a preference to keep only those fish that meet a minimum size. If he/she catches a fish that is less than that preferred size, the fish is thrown back into the pond. Also, all fishers are allowed to catch only a maximum of 10 fishes at a time and anything more is not allowed.
